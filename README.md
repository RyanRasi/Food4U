A recipe app that takes ingredients from the user and displays 3 recipes from which they can use. Also has ability to add preferences such as dietary requirements, intolerances and excluded ingredients.<br><br>
This recipe app uses the Spoonacular API to display recipes based on the users paramters such as the ingredients at hand but also has the ability to allow the user to specify preferences such as any dietary requirements such as vegan, vegetarian, the ability to specify intolerances such as lactose and gluten as well as if they want to exclude any ingredients such as mushrooms.
<br><br>
These are saved in a local text file. <br><br>Once the user has selected their ingredients they can view a recipe in more detail with a numbered selection from 1 - 3 and then they can choose to email the recipe to themselves or they can go back to the main menu to choose another set of paramters if they choose to do so.<br><br>All of the user inputs are checked for input validation so only the desired choices can be picked and the user is promted to try again if the data inputted fails validation.
